### **Additional Notes**
- **Remaining Lectures**: After Day 30, some lectures (e.g., Salt Analysis, Metallurgy, Surface Chemistry, and additional Physics chapters) will remain. Plan to cover these during a 10-day revision phase (Days 31-40).
- **Practice**: After finishing each chapter, solve related problems to reinforce your understanding.
- **Revision (Days 31-40)**: Use this time to review completed chapters, finish any leftover lectures, and take mock tests.
